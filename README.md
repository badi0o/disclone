This project accompanies the following posts:

Although the project is written to be secure, its simplicity requires careful considerations for usage in sensitive productions. [File an issue](https://github.com/hoangvvo/nextjs-mongodb-app/issues/new/choose) if you spot any security problems.

<h3 align="center">Dependencies</h3>

This project uses the following dependencies:

- `next.js` - v9.3 or above required for **API Routes** and new [**new data fetching method**](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getserversideprops-server-side-rendering).
- `react` - v16.8 or above required for **react hooks**.
- `react-dom` - v16.8 or above.
- `swr` - required for state management, may be replaced with `react-query`
- `mongodb` - may be replaced by `mongoose`.
- `passport`, `passport-local` - required for authentication.
- `next-connect` - recommended if you want to use Express/Connect middleware and easier method routing.
- `next-session`, `connect-mongo` - required for session, may be replaced with other session libraries such as `cookie-session`, `next-iron-session`, or `express-session` (`express-session` is observed not to work properly on Next.js 11+).
- `bcryptjs` - optional, may be replaced with any password-hashing library. `argon2` recommended.
- `validator` - optional but recommended, to validate email.
- `ajv` - optional but recommended, to validate request body.
- `multer` - may be replaced with any middleware that handles `multipart/form-data`
- `cloudinary` - optional, **only if** you are using [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com) for image upload.
- several other optional dependencies for cosmetic purposes.
- `nodemailer` - optional, **only if** you use it for email. It is recommended to use 3rd party services like [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/), [AWS SES](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/), etc. instead.

<h2 align="center">Deployment</h2>

This project can be deployed [anywhere Next.js can be deployed](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment). Make sure to set the environment variables using the options provided by your cloud/hosting providers.

After building using `npm run build`, simply start the server using `npm run start`.

You can also deploy this with serverless providers given the correct setup.
